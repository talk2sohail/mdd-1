                  described online activities we own or control, including any
                  online activities owned, controlled, or operated by Cashify
                  Affiliates, (collectively, the “Site”). In addition, please
                  review the Site’s&nbsp;Terms of Use&nbsp;which governs your
                  use of the Service, and includes, among other things, grants
                  of rights from you and limits on our liability and your
                  remedies. It also describes the choices available to you

                <p>
                  By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy
                  Policy. If you do not agree with the practices described in
                  this Privacy Policy, please do not provide us with your
                  personal information or interact with the Site.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any
                  material changes, we will notify you by means of a notice on
                  the Site prior to the change becoming effective.

                <p>
                  Cashify strives to give the best offers to sell your old
                  gadget; then Cashify refers you to a buyer for your product.
                  We will share your personal information with these carefully
                  selected buyers only when you agree to submit for a quote.
                  This means we do not take your credit card/debit card
                  information and we do not take your money. Registration on
                  Cashify is voluntary; if you do decide to register, we will
                  not share your personal information until you agree to submit
                  to a quote. Subject to your registration, you do get access to
                  certain features, but membership is not necessary to find sale
                  offers. If you have questions or complaints regarding our
                  privacy policy or practices, please contact us.
                </p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

                <p>
                  We collect standard information about Cashify users such as IP
                  addresses, browser type, operating system, device type, what
                  you searched for, referring and exit pages, the dates and
                  times of visits, and other site usage behavior (“Site
                  Visitation Data”).Site Visitation Data is used to administer
                  the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of
                  Cashify. We may also use Site Visitation Data to share
                  important updates and information through email &amp; SMS, and
                  also prevent communication that you might not interest you.
                  While selling or registering with our Site, as appropriate,
                  you may be asked to enter your name, email address, mailing
                  address or phone number. You may, however, visit our site
                  anonymously. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a
                  safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows
                  us to provide services and features that most likely meet your
                  needs, and to customize our Site to make your experience safer
                  and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect
                  personal information from you that we consider necessary for
                  achieving this purpose.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Like most websites, we use cookies and/or web beacons to
                  enhance your experience, gather general visitor information,
                  and track visits to our website. Please refer to the section
                  below entitled “Use of cookies and tracking technology” for
                  information about cookies and how we use them.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To help improve our site and services, we may collect certain
                  technical information from your browser software, screen
                  resolution and the website that referred you to us.
                </p>

                <h2>Sharing information with friends and in user forums</h2>

                <p>
                  The Cashify allows you to share certain information with
                  friends that you select. Please bear in mind that Cashify
                  cannot control what your friends do with the information you
                  share with them, so you should only share with friends you
                  trust. Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages,
                  information that you share can be collected and used by
                  others. To request removal of your personal information from
                  our blog or community forum, please contact us
                  at&nbsp;info@Cashify.in. In some cases, we may not be able to
                  remove your personal information, in which case we will let
                  you know if we are unable to do so and why.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Furthermore, if you participate in a user forum on the Cashify
                  website, your comments and your Cashify username will be
                  displayed to all Cashify users on the forum. Cashify is not
                  responsible for what any user or third party may do with
                  information that you choose to share.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We may also provide a feature allowing you to invite a friend
                  to join Cashify. If you provide a friend’s email address to us
                  for this reason, we will use that email address only for the
                  purpose of sending a onetime invitation to your friend. Your
                  friend may contact us at&nbsp;<a>info@Cashify.in&nbsp;</a>to
                  remove their information from our database.
                </p>

                <h2>Use of personal information</h2>

                <p>
                  We will treat your personal information as confidential, and
                  we will not share your personal information with third parties
                  without your permission, except in the limited circumstances
                  described below. If you accept a referral from Cashify to one
                  of our partner sites, we may provide PII to the partner site
                  to save you having to re-enter that information. When you
                  select a partner site to sell your article(s) to, you must opt
                  in to allow your PII to be submitted to that partner site, and
                  you agree to be bound by their privacy policy as regards use
                  of your PII.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We may provide your personal information to companies that
                  provide services to help us with our business activities such
                  as fulfilling your request for a free shipping kit, purchasing
                  your article(s), or sending confirmation or other emails.
                  These companies are authorized to use your personal
                  information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We may provide your personal information to our third party
                  marketing partners so they may offer you goods and services
                  which you may find of interest. If you do not wish to receive
                  offers from these third parties, you may unsubscribe from
                  their mailing lists by following the instructions in the
                  offer. If you respond to any such offer, your information will
                  be subject to that third party’s privacy policy. We may
                  disclose personal information if required to do so by law or
                  in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
                  necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders and to protect
                  and defend the rights and interests of Cashify, its
                  affiliates, suppliers, or users. In the event Cashify goes
                  through a business transition, such as a merger, being
                  acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its
                  assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances,
                  be part of the assets transferred.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We may use and disclose your aggregated usage information with
                  others, in a form that does not identify any individual, to
                  allow Cashify and our advertisers to present targeted
                  advertising to you. We may disclose to third parties,
